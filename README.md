## Projec Summary and Background
A stakeholder is preparing to start a new business in the surfing world, and he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results with analysis
After analyzing June and December data, we can see the outcomes in the following tables:
The translation of the outcomes is as follow:

•	We have more data points available for June than December
•	June temperatures range from 64 to 85 °F, whereas December Temps range from 56 to 83 °F.
•	The average temperature in June is 75 °F, whereas in December it is 71 °F. 
•	The temperature in December is more spread out from the mean than in June since the standard deviation for December temperatures is higher.
•	50% of June and December temperatures are above 75 and 71 °F, respectively.

## Summary
Based on the outcomes, after studying the temperature as one of the factors that might affect the decision of the stakeholder to open the store, since 50% of the analyzed data points fall above 71 °F, we can consider that overall it is suitable for surfing business, even tho the temperature is more sustainable during June, and we can see it looking at the standard deviation. Also, we have to consider that the volume of sales most probably drops in December from where it was in June.
